# 🔊 Voice-Activated Emergency Alert System

A **voice-controlled IoT safety device** designed to instantly alert emergency contacts when the user says **“Help Me”** — ensuring rapid response and peace of mind in critical situations.

---

##  Overview

The **Voice-Activated Emergency Alert System** is a compact, portable safety device built to detect a voice command and send an emergency SMS to predefined contacts.  
It combines **edge computing**, **machine learning**, and **GSM-based communication** for immediate and reliable alerts without requiring an internet connection.

---

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The system consists of three main modules that work together seamlessly:

1. **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**  
   - Performs voice recognition using on-board microphone  
   - Runs an embedded ML model built with **Edge Impulse**  
   - Handles command processing and control logic  

2. **GSM SIM900 Module**  
   - Sends SMS messages to pre-configured emergency contacts  
   - Operates on standard GSM networks  
   - Uses hardware serial communication  

3. **Voltage Level Shifter**  
   - Converts 3.3V ↔ 5V logic levels between Nano BLE and GSM module  
   - Protects hardware components from voltage mismatches

## 🧩 Core Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Arduino Nano 33 BLE** | Edge computing microcontroller with integrated microphone |
| **GSM SIM900 Module** | For SMS-based emergency communication |
| **Voltage Level Shifter** | Ensures safe logic-level conversion |
| **SIM Card (with SMS plan)** | Enables mobile network connectivity |
| **Power Source (Li-ion Battery)** | Makes the system portable |

## 🧬 Machine Learning Model (Edge Impulse)

The **Edge Impulse** platform was used for:

- **Data Acquisition:** Capturing and labeling “Help Me” audio samples  
- **Model Training:** Building a neural network to detect the phrase  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing performance and reducing false triggers  
- **Testing:** Ensuring robust recognition in noisy environments  

Once trained, the model was deployed directly to the **Nano 33 BLE** for **on-device inference**.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **Voice Activation:**  
   The user says “Help Me”.

2. **Processing:**  
   The Nano 33 BLE detects the voice command using the trained Edge Impulse model.

3. **Alert Transmission:**  
   The GSM SIM900 module sends an SMS alert to the preset contact numbers.

4. **Notification:**  
   The contact receives the emergency message instantly.
